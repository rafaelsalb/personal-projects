        <h1>About</h1>

        <div class="about">
            <p>I'm Rafael da Silva Albuquerque, 20 years old, a sophomore Computer Science student at University of Fortaleza (Unifor). Born in Fortaleza, Ceará and raised in Curitiba, Paraná.</p>
            <p>Computers have been a major part of my life since I was 4 years old, when I mostly played computer games. I used the computer for hours at a time and looked for solutions whenever I faced an obstacle that impeded whatever I was trying to do. In this process, I learned to read, write and speak in english. In 2020, a friend of mine introduced me to a Python programming course, and I was immediately hooked, as I naturally enjoy solving problems. Mathematics and Physics are some of my other interests, so this pushed me forward on improving my programming skills in order to make projects related to that, such as John Conway's Game of Life, and others which I plan to release publicly soon.</p>
            <p>This portfolio shows some of my work, which covers different areas of Computer Science, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Computer graphics</li>
                <li>Sorting algorithms</li>
                <li>Cryptography</li>
                <li>Automatons</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The reason I developed the projects you can find here is mostly because I was doing research aimlessly on my free time and ended up stumbling upon some subject that sparked my interest. As of march 19th 2023, I have done no paid work and usually develop for improving my skills, for fun and sometimes for university assignments.</p>
            <p>I have used and familiarized myself with the following programming languages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>C</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>C# (currently studying)</li>
                <li>JavaScript (on a superficial level)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The main challenge in making this web portfolio is using the web development tools, as I'm not very well versed with HTML and CSS, am a begginner at JavaScript, and currently go by intuition and observation on the UI/UX. It's been a fun and productive process, nonetheless, as I enjoy the challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the reason mentioned just before, the pages may show some bugs and issues, but I'm working whenever I have the time to fix them and improve the overall product.
            </p>
